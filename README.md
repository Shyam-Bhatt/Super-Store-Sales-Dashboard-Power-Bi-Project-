📊 Super Store Sales Dashboard – Power BI Project

This repository contains a fully interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze sales, profit, customer segments, and operational performance for a retail Super Store. The project helps business stakeholders make data-driven decisions by providing a clear visual overview of key performance metrics.

🧩 1. Business Problem

Retail businesses generate large amounts of sales and customer data, but without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to understand:
Which products contribute the most to revenue
Which regions or segments perform better
How sales and profit behave across different months
How customer buying habits change over time
The Super Store needed a single dashboard that provides insights into sales trends, profit fluctuations, shipping behavior, and customer segments to support better strategic planning and decision-making.

❓ 2. Key Questions to Answer

This dashboard was designed to answer the following business questions:
Sales & Product Insights
What are the total sales, profit, and quantity sold?
Which categories and sub-categories drive the most revenue?
Which regions are performing well or underperforming?
Customer Behavior
Which customer segment buys the most?
What payment modes are most commonly used?
Operational Insights
Which shipping mode is used the most?
Are there patterns in shipping performance?
Trend Analysis
How do Monthly Sales and Monthly Profit compare Year-over-Year (2019 vs 2020)?
Are there seasonal spikes or dips in performance?
